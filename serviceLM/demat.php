                <h3 class="mb-4">What is a Demat Account?</h3>
                <p>A Demat account (short for "Dematerialized Account") is an electronic account used to hold securities such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and other financial instruments in digital form. Instead of dealing with cumbersome physical certificates, a Demat account allows investors to store and manage their securities in a safe and accessible way. This account is a crucial tool for anyone engaging in securities trading, as it is required to buy, sell, or transfer shares on the stock exchange.</p>
